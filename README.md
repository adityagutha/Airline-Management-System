This Airline Management System is a robust relational database solution designed to streamline complex aviation operations, from flight scheduling to passenger management. Built using MySQL, the project features a sophisticated schema modeled through Enhanced Entity-Relationship Diagrams (EERD) to ensure data integrity and optimized performance. To automate system-wide logic, I implemented 13 stored procedures for seamless data modifications and 6 relational views for secure, role-based querying. This system demonstrates advanced database design principles, including complex constraint handling and efficient physical schema implementation using hand-typed SQL.
